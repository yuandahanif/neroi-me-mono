This disgusting, icky-yucky shithole of a reality
Will all be wiped from your minds by the angel of charity, me!
Oh, but don't tell any of the adults, okay?
Everything's going to be all right, don't be afraid now
</pre>

<pre>
You pretend to understand, but you know nothing, do you?
Oh, what is sadness, really, now? What do you think loneliness is? Are
you listening?
Can you all interact with me, but also get away from me? On it loops…
My favorite time of day is night, but it gets so cold by myself… Someone
hold me please.
</pre>

<pre>
Running through my body is ecstasy, melting down my throat is Myslee
My screen illuminates the dark, bathing me in anxiety
Can someone come and kill me please… Wait, no, I still don't wanna
die
Can the sun just never rise again?
I'm dying! Kill! Me! My head is gonna f*ckin explode!!!!!<a href="https://www.lyrical-nonsense.com/global/lyrics/aiobahn-x-kotoko/internet-yamero/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1</a>

In the end, 
We are all alone.

Slowly decay into nothingness.
With all the memories of the past.

Consumed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQfyb0aowN8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the void of existence</a>.
Second of the eternity just passed.

No one will understand us.
We are own unique existence.

No matter how hard we try.
No word can describe what we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX0xWJpr0FY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see, think, and feel</a>.

Until the end of time.
We will be alone.

Are everything even real?
Or just a figment of our imagination?

Tidak ada maksud apa-apa di sini. Silahkan interpretasikan semuanya
