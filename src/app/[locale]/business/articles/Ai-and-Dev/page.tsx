// Idea to write later:
// `main theme of the article is satire, to mock thos who are FOMO about AI, thos who invent the problem for a solution that doesn't exist.
// like AI for HR whos job to hire people is countered by the AI to apply for a job,
// if this realy continue, we all gona trully replaced by AI. its a self fullfilling prophecy.
// while our society is being disensitive to the real problem, like climate change, by our own algorithm god.
