          There is only two way I can archive this, either i become good at what
          i curently do (Frontend) or I switch career to Art. Both require me to
          be good at something, and a lot of time and effort.

          The burden of responsibility of using your waifu as your profile is
          heavy. To become one with the waifu, you must first become one with
          yourself. Embrace the cringe, and let it flow through you.

          Separataion of work and personal life is a myth. You are your work,
          and your work is you. You can&apos;t escape from yourself, so you
          might as well embrace it. Work life balance? just let me work until i
          rot.

          ads, give me more targeted content, give me more distraction, give me
          that new shiny thing, I WANT MOREEEEEE.

          better, but that is a lot of work. So i will be offgrid, and live in a

          will be free from the shackles of society, and live a life of peace.
